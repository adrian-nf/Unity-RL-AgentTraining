# Unity-RL-AgentTraining [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adrian-nf/Unity-RL-AgentTraining/blob/main/TrainAgent.ipynb)

This repository provides an automated solution for training Unity agents using reinforcement learning in Google Colab. The notebook allows you to train your agent with minimal setup, following the structure and teachings from Unit 7: Hands-on of the Hugging Face Deep Reinforcement Learning course.

## Inspiration

This notebook is inspired by the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Course on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit7/hands-on), specifically Unit 7: Hands-on. In the original course, Unit 7 provides practical reinforcement learning implementations that are designed to run locally. However, since the rest of the course uses Google Colab for a seamless experience, I have adapted Unit 7 to work in Colab, automating the entire process so that users can run it without needing to set up the environment manually.

The content was originally created by the Hugging Face team, and this notebook serves as an adaptation for Unity-based agent training using reinforcement learning, with all the steps automated for a Colab environment.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Notebook in Google Colab**:
   - You can open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/adrian-nf/Unity-RL-AgentTraining/blob/main/TrainAgent.ipynb).

2. **Training the Agent**:
   - Follow the instructions provided in the notebook. The notebook automates the process: simply press play to run each cell and continue through the training. It also includes steps for stopping and resuming training if needed.

## Features

- **Automated Training**: The notebook automates the setup of the Unity environment, agent training, and monitoring, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
- **Simple Workflow**: Users only need to click play in Colab to execute the entire training process, with no additional setup required.
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: The notebook provides clear instructions and explains the entire training process, including options to pause and resume training.
